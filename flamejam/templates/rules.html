<h1>Game Jam Rules</h1>

<div class="info">
    <p>
        These rules are laid down to allow a fun, entertaining and fair event
        for everyone. They are subject for iteration and improvement. These
        rules apply to all jams, unless otherwise stated.
    </p>

    <p>
        The admins may remove entries if they do not conform to these
        regulations.
    </p>
</div>

<a name="procedure"></a><h2>Procedure</h2>

<div class="info">
    <p>
        Every game jam can be divided into the following states:
    </p>

    <ul class="normal">
        <li><b>Announcement</b> (usually ~2 weeks before the jam)</li>
        <li><b>Programming</b> (usually 48 hours)</li>
        <li><b>Packaging</b> (usually 24 hours)</li>
        <li><b>Voting</b> (usually 1 week)</li>
        <li><b>Finished</b></li>
    </ul>
</div>

<a name="theme"></a><h2>Theme</h2>
<div class="info">
    <p>
        The theme will be randomly chosen from suggestions from the
        previous jams, from IRC and from the subreddit. It will be announced
        at the beginning of the contest here, in the
        <a href="http://reddit.com/r/bacongamejam" target="_blank">
            RedditGameJam subreddit</a>
        and on <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}#irc">IRC</a>. Everyone
        may suggest a theme.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participants who have registered with the option to receive
        email notifications will also receive the theme by email.
    </p>
    <p>
        All entries must have something to do with the theme. We won't
        be fussy about that, though, so it's ok if the theme is not the
        main thing of your project, but it has to be visible.
        Browse the <a href="{{ url_for('jams') }}">list of jams</a> to see what
        has been chosen as theme previously.
    </p>
</div>

<a name="artwork"></a><h2>Artwork</h2>
<div class="info">
    <p>
        Freely available, external artwork may be used as long as a source
        is provided in the posted game. The artwork authors should be
        credited. This applies to sounds and graphics likewise.
    </p>
</div>

<a name="cross-platform"></a><h2>Cross-platform</h2>
<div class="info">
    <p>
        Making a cross-platform game is strongly encouraged. However, you
        are not required to make your game cross-platform in order to
        participate. Be aware that the community does not consist only of
        Windows users. A user may downvote your game if it can't run on the
        user's platform.
    </p>
</div>

<a name="libraries-engines"></a><h2>Libraries/Engines</h2>
<div class="info">
    <p>
        Any freely available external libraries may be used for your game.
        The library doesn't need to be <a title="Wikipedia: Free and open source software"
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software" target="_blank">
        FOSS</a> but it can't be payware. Proprietary engines like
        <a href="http://www.udk.com/" target="_blank">UDK</a> and <a href="http://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a>
        are alright.
    </p>
</div>

<a name="snippets-personal-code"></a><h2>Snippets/personal Code</h2>

<div class="info">
    </p>
        If you want to reuse pre-existing code of yours, it must have been
        available in source form for the public to see a fair amount of time
        prior to the start of the contest. The same goes for random snippets
        of code.
    </p>
</div>

<a name="hardware-compatibility"></a><h2>Hardware compatibility</h2>

<div class="info">
    <p>
        Your game will be run by netbook users as well as high-performance
        desktop users. If you make a game full of shaders and fancy graphics
        stuff, do not expect everyone to be able to run it. You are free to
        do this, though. Be sensible.
    </p>
</div>

<a name="packaging"></a><h2>Packaging</h2>

<div class="info">
    <p>
        When packaging, you are not required to provide the full source of
        your game with the release, it is encouraged however. Game jams
        are a learning effort for everyone and the games created for it provide
        excellent and small working examples. Do not be scared about losing
        your copyright, even if you choose a copyleft license. The code is
        still yours and you may use it commercially afterwards, regardless
        of the license you choose for this game jam. External libraries should
        be included in the most sensible way. A small library like zlib may
        be put directly into the sources if this is more convenient. A bigger
        library like Ogre3D should only be referred. You will get some extra time
        (usually one day) for packaging your game after the jam has ended.
        Ask in <a href="{{ url_for('contact') }}#irc">IRC</a> if you need
        help with compiling/packaging.
    </p>
</div>

<a name="source-control"></a><h2>Source control</h2>

<div class="info">
    <p>
        Use of a publicly accessible source control system is encouraged
        but not required. <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>
        is recommended. To make this clear, you are not required to share
        your source but again, you are encouraged to do so.
    </p>
</div>

<a name="team-size"></a><h2>Team size</h2>

<div class="info">
    <p>
        <b>Solo jams:</b>
        You have to work on your own. All content that is being created for
        your game within the time of the game has to come from you. That includes
        the source (except external resources or older snippets available to
        the public), artwork, sound and everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Team jams:</b>
        You can work in teams. The team size is stated in the jam description,
        if not, it's unlimited. Your team can include coders, artists, game
        designers, composers, anyone.
    </p>
</div>

<a name="time-limit"></a><h2>Time limit</h2>

<div class="info">
    <p>
        The time limit is stated in the jam details. A normal jam runs for
        48 hours, starting from the announcement of the theme in IRC.
        Any work after the deadline is purely minor bug fixing, compatibility
        fixing and packaging. No gameplay changes allowed.
    </p>
